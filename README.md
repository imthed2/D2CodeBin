# D2CodeBin

This repository contains small examples or code snippets. The current example is a simple Tkinter application that shows a button. When you click the button, it displays "Hello World" in a pop-up dialog.

## Running the example

Make sure you have Python 3 installed. Then run:

```bash
python hello_button.py
```

This will open a window with a single button labeled **Click me**. Clicking the button shows a message box saying "Hello World".
